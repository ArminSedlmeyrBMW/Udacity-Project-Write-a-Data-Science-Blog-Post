    "# Write a Data Science Blog Post @Udacity - Become a Data Scientist\n",
    "\n",
    "by Armin Sedlmeyr, a Udacity student from Munich, Germany working @BMW Group\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software used:\n",

    "## General Project Requirements:\n",
    "> **Code Functionality and Readability**:\n",
    "- [ ] Code has easy-to-follow logical structure. The code uses comments effectively and/or Notebook Markdown cells correctly. The steps of the data science process (gather, assess, clean, analyze, model, visualize) are clearly identified with comments or Markdown cells, as well. The naming for variables and functions should be according to PEP8 style guide.\n",
    "- [ ] All the project code is contained in a Jupyter notebook, which demonstrates successful execution and output of the code.\n",
    "- [ ] Code is well documented and uses functions and classes as necessary. All functions include document strings. DRY principles are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Data**:\n",
    "- [ ] Project follows the CRISP-DM process outlined for questions through communication. This can be done in the README or the notebook. If a question does not require machine learning, descriptive or inferential statistics should be used to create a compelling answer to a particular question.\n",
    "- [ ] Categorical variables are handled appropriately for machine learning models (if models are created). Missing values are also handled appropriately for both descriptive and ML techniques. Document why a particular approach was used, and why it was appropriate for a particular situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Analysis, Modeling, Visualization**:\n",
    "- [ ] There are between 3-5 questions asked, related to the business or real-world context of the data. Each question is answered with an appropriate visualization, table, or statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Github Repository**:\n",
    "- [ ] Student must have a Github repository of their project. The repository must have a README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgements. Students should not use another student's code to complete the project, but they may use other references on the web including StackOverflow and Kaggle to complete the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Blog Post**:\n",
    "- [ ] Student must have a blog post on a platform of their own choice (can be on their website, a Medium post or Github blog post). Student must communicate their results clearly. The post should not dive into technical details or difficulties of the analysis - this should be saved for Github. The post should be understandable for non-technical people from many fields.\n",
    "- [ ] Student must have a title and image to draw readers to their post.\n",
    "- [ ] There are no long, ongoing blocks of text without line breaks or images for separation anywhere in the post.\n",
    "- [ ] Each question is answered with a clear visual, table, or statistic that provides how the data supports or disagrees with some hypothesis that could be formed by each question of interest.\n",

    "        - _Validity_: we have the records, but they're not valid, i.e., they don't conform to a defined schema. A schema is a defined set of rules for data. These rules can be real-world constraints (e.g. negative height is impossible) and table-specific constraints (e.g. unique key constraints in tables).\n",
    "        - _Accuracy_: inaccurate data is wrong data that is valid (meaning is being technically possible, e.g. a height, that is way to low, but still is valid in the dataset, or someone named \"Dsvid\", that is not illegal, e.g. technically possible, but not probable). It adheres to the defined schema, but it is still incorrect. Example: a patient's weight that is 5 lbs too heavy because the scale was faulty.\n",
    "        - _Consistency_: inconsistent data is both valid and accurate, but there are multiple correct ways of referring to the same thing. Consistency, i.e., a standard format, in columns that represent the same data across tables and/or within tables is desired.

    "        - We'll have legacy data systems, where data wasn't coded when disc and memory constraints were much more restrictive than they are now. Over time systems evolve. Needs change, and data changes.\n",

Here is a clue to my personality:  Favorite singers are Judy Collins, Ari Hest, Miguel Bose and the British rock band, James. My top favorite places to travel to are Oaxaca, Mexico and Budapest, Hungary. In years gone by, I have had repeated trips to Paris and to Tunisia, also. These days I am mostly home, spending a lot of time in front of my iMac, writing copy, filling orders or coding for websites.</td>\n",

The #38 bus stops one-half block away, and takes you past the Faulkner, then to Jamaica Plain and Forest Hills.  The #51 bus stops one block away, and goes a more direct route to Forest Hills. (The bus also goes to Cleveland Circle in Brookline.) Between the two bus lines, there is a bus that stops here every 15 minutes or so on weekdays; but no service on Sunday. ALSO, the apartment is just 1/2 mile walk to the Roslindale Village MBTA commuter rail stop, Needham Line. The train takes you to Ruggles Station at Northeastern Univ., to Back Bay station and to South Station in downtown Boston, in about 15 minutes time.  There are more city busses, running 7 days a week, from this MBTA rail station. You can also pick up ZIP Cars there.

Locals walk and bike in the Arnold Arboretum, a 265-acre oasis that is part of Frederick Law Olmsted's Emerald Necklace.....Roslindale Village is the city's original Main Street district and now one of the city's most vibrant, featuring several bistros, unique shops, and wireless Internet access.

(If you're at South Station, the MBTA is right at the bus station)  Take the MBTA subway to the \"Orange line\" train stop at Forest Hills station (it involves a switch that doesn't cost money).  From there, go to the Washington Street side of the station (not the Hyde Park Avenue side) and get bus #35, 36 or 37.  Get off at the Belgrade Avenue &amp; Walworth Street stop (by 165 Belgrade Avenue).  My home is a 3-minute walk from there.   The MBTA website has a tab \"Rider Tools\" which will give you excellent, detailed routes and times to get anywhere in the city.   2. Take a cab - which usually $35 to 40 from Logan and much less from South Station, unless there is terrible traffic.  3. Or you could follow step #1 to Forest Hills Station, then take a cab from there (they are lined up) to my home (about $5-7). 4.

This is about one-half mile from Faulkner Hospital, walking distance to the renowned Arnold Arboretum park (look for it on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)), and about 20-minute drive to the Longwood Medical Center area. I have easy, restriction-free, on-street parking here, and a back yard. Just one block from the house, there is a 7-11 convenience store, a dry-cleaner, a Mexican restaurant, a pizza parlor, a popular sports bar and grill (similar to an Irish Pub), and another restaurant for breakfast and lunch.  The house is located 1/2 mile from Roslindale Square where you will find more restaurants, 4 bakeries, the public library and the post office. There is a superb farmers market here every Saturday. The fast-train to downtown Boston stops there, too.                                                  \n",
       "3  Roslindale is a lovely little neighborhood located right in the city of Boston.  Though a part of the actual city, once you enter it, you feel as though you have escaped to a suburb with friendly neighbors.  The area is conveniently located with access to the city’s bus and subway system.  The Orange Line and Commuter Rail services connect the area to the heart of Boston and the neighboring towns.  It is situated close to shops, restaurants, grocery stores, parks and neighboring towns.  The farmer’s market held in the neighborhood’s center, Roslindale Village, and goes on all summer on Saturday morning.  Vendors of all different types of arts, crafts, and foods come to the neighborhood.  The Arnold Arboretum is a 265 acre park constructed as part of Frederick Law Olmsted’s Emerald Necklace project to provide Boston a connection through neighborhoods through it’s parks.  Jamaica Pond is also part of the emerald necklace which sits at the confluence of Jamaica Plain (a neighboring neighb   \n",

In addition, I enjoy singing as my hobby.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe want you too feel at home while you are staying with us.  If we are at the house during your visit, we will provide you with breakfast treats and be there to assist you with any of your needs.  The house if often empty on weekends as we all enjoy spending time outside doing activities, meeting friends/family or traveling.  If we are present, we can provide a hot breakfast but if not, cereal, bread, butter, jam, eggs and milk along with pancake mix will be available.  We will provide a list of contacts you can contact if we are not at home.  Our house is incredibly comfortable and we hope you enjoy the experience of sleeping on the beautiful king sized bed with plush down bedding.  We also hope you enjoy access to the movie channels on the Smart TV which is in the living area attached to your bedroom.     \n",
       "4  I work full time for a public school district.   My two wonderful adult sons live in their own homes in Boston.  Camping, bicycling, music, reading, and quiet time with friends and family are what I enjoy.  I love going to church and being part of the church community. Boston is a great place to live and every day I am happy to be here!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy hosting style is \"available\" but not \"hovering\"!  Some people want to be completely on their own and others like a little connection and appreciate the host being available.  I am happy to accommodate your style.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
